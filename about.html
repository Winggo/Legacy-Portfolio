        <h2>About Me.</h2>
				<p>
          Others have told me that one of my prevailing characteristics is my desire to explore and seek new experiences. And that is my philisophy: that there is always something more out there that I can reach for, and to never settle in place. This is because throughout my life I have discovered that there are so many aspects and shades of life. To only be able to live out a tiny fragment of what is possible in this world would be limiting yourself to the circumstances that you were given. I wish to see the world in unique perspectives and portray it to those I meet. Welcome to my life, and I'm glad to be able to share it with you.
        </p>

          My name is <i>Winggo Tse</i> and I'm a third year computer science student at University of California, Santa Cruz. I decided to create this website not only to showcase my work but to also use it as a platform to reach out to others who wish to get to know more about me. I would love to listen to your story, whether you share a similar interest or are someone who was inspired, wherever you're from.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a student, much of my life is dedicated to learning and taking on challenges. Building this website was a learning experience and my first step into the web development field. I saw the oppurtunity to showcase a passion of mine with what I study--my career. And I can only see myself spending more time studying web development because like photography, web development is another way of showcasing a perspective. I wish to use this first step to transition into more complex computer science projects. And as I have said before, there is always something more out there I can reach for so I seek to always keep improving. This season I am looking for an internship that will give me the experience to open up more possibilities. I would love to gain more experiences in software engineering and am always open to oppurtunities to improve. Feel free to reach out to me!
