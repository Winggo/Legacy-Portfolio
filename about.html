        <h2>About Me.</h2>
				<p>
          I have always been told that one of my prevailing characteristics is my desire to explore and seek new experiences. And that is my philisophy: that there is always something more out there that I can reach for, and to never settle in place. This is because throughout my life I have discovered that there are so many aspects and shades of life. To only be able to live out a tiny fragment of what is possible in this world would be limiting yourself to the circumstances that you were given. I wish to see the world in unique perspectives and portray it to those I meet. 
        </p>
        <p>
          My name is <i>Winggo Tse</i> and I'm a third year computer science student at University of California, Santa Cruz. I decided to create this website not only to showcase my work but to also use it as a platform to reach out to others who wish to get to know more about me. I would love to listen to what you have to share, whether you share a similar interest or are someone who was inspired, wherever you're from.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a student, much of my time is dedicated to learning and taking on challenges. Building this website was a learning experience and a first step in doing what I love â€” creating and inspiring others. And I can only see myself spending more time creating through photography and showcasing different perspectives of the world. I wish to be able to combine computer science and my passion for creating content into bigger projects in the future. And as I have said before, there is always something more out there I can reach for so my aim is to constantly be improving. This season I am looking for an internship that will give me the experience to open up more possibilities. I would love to gain more experiences in software engineering or photography. Feel free to reach out to me!
