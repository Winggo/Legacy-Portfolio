I created this personal project with the intention of showcasing myself, documenting places I've been to with people I've met, and displaying moments I've found to be meaningful throughout my adventures. I've always wanted to combine my hobbies and interests with my career somehow and I making something like this fits the slot quite nicely. This will always be an ongoing project: new places to go, more people to meet, wild expereiences to face. All I can say is that I wish to make the most of it.
